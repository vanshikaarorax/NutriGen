#steps
# pip install pymupdf tiktoken supabase openai tqdm python-dotenv
#create env then instlal these packages
#then python ingest.py
#now process is everthing going on then 
#then check the supabase table see if its updated
#then for creating frontend 
# (2) npx create-next-app rag-chat -- ts
#(3) cd rag-chat
#(4) npm i @supabase/supabase-js openai
#so now after next project is created
#go in src/app then create api folder then inside it create chat folder add route.ts 
#create route.ts with chatgpt-The user query is first converted to openai embedding then you have to call match documents functions from supabase
#this function will retrive those top 5 chunks from db based on similarity scores also add if it coudnt finf sorry i coudnt find
#usually when the proper chunks match in supabse they convert into context goes into prompt then asking model for completion
#now there is page.ts which is an interface src/app/page.ts or idk src/page.ts check which one has layout.ts whichever has then place page.ts beside it
#beside src in rag-chat create .env.local and paste same env as before here
#create a test_embedding.py file this is nothing but using this you can check whther everything works or not like query answering
#now npm run dev now it is answering questions answers
#now go to lovabkle give it sql info and ingest.py info give page.tsx and route.ts full files make ui cool give a cool prompt it will host also it also lets you see references when you hover on page numeber


#what is happening in route.ts is whenevr you get query from user it gets conversted into open ai embdeiing using embedd function and tghe match function is called from the supabase in sql editor in supabase

#then after it reuturna ,most matching if not then then gives i couldnt find this in doc then we call gpt chat completion

then for page.ts
